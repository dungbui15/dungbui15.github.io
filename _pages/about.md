Since October 2021, I am a PhD student at [IRIF](https://www.irif.fr/), Université Paris Cité, under the supervision of [Geoffroy Couteau](https://geoffroycouteau.github.io/). In 2019 -- 2021, I got my Master's degree in Cryptology and Information Security [Cryptis program](https://www.cryptis.fr/) at Université de Limoges.

My research interests are in various aspects of both practical and theoretical cryptography; including secure multiparty computation, MPC-in-the-Head, and zero-knowledge proofs. For an up-to-date list of my publications, you can check my [publication page](https://dungbui15.github.io/publications/) or my [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=StGOHMUAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1). All my publications become available at some point in open-access format on the ePrint archive; see the list [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/search?q=&title=&authors=dung+bui). My Master's thesis can be found [here](/files/master_thesis.pdf).
