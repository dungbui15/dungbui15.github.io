Since October 2021, I am a PhD student at [IRIF](https://www.irif.fr/), Université Paris Cité, under the supervision of [Geoffroy Couteau](https://geoffroycouteau.github.io/). In 2019 -- 2021, I got my Master's degree in Cryptology and Information Security [Cryptis program](https://www.cryptis.fr/) at Université de Limoges. 

My research interests are in various aspects of both practical and theoretical cryptography, including secure multiparty computation, zero-knowledge proofs, and post-quantum cryptography. For an up-to-date list of my publications, you can check my [publication page](https://dungbui15.github.io/publications/) or my [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=StGOHMUAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1). My CV can be found [here](/files/PhD_CV.pdf).

### Experiences
I spent the summer of 2023 as a research intern at [COSIC](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/) hosted by [Nigel Smart](https://nigelsmart.github.io/), and the summer of 2024 interning at [NTT Social Informatics Laboratories](https://www.rd.ntt/e/sil/), working with [Masayuki Abe](https://security-kouza.github.io/nanacov/). 

Before starting my PhD, I interned at [XLIM](https://www.xlim.fr/en) in the summer of 2020 under the supervision of [Duong Hieu Phan](https://www.di.ens.fr/users/phan/index.html),  and in the summer of 2021, I worked as an intern at [IRIF](https://www.irif.fr/) with [Geoffroy Couteau](https://geoffroycouteau.github.io/).
